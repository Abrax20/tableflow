<Info>Feature available in <a href="https://tableflow.com/pricing" target="_blank">TableFlow Cloud</a>.</Info>

TableFlow uses webhooks to push real-time notifications about your data imports. For example, you can use webhooks on TableFlow to get notified when a user completes a file import:

1. Your user imports a CSV or Excel file using the embedded TableFlow importer on your web app
2. TableFlow notifies your system, via a webhook, that a data import has been completed
3. Your system can use the API to [paginate through the imported data](/api-reference/get-import-rows), or [download the data directly as a CSV file](/api-reference/download-import).

## Configure your application to receive webhooks

To get started, create an endpoint where you can receive webhooks. For this example, we’ll use [Svix Play](https://play.svix.com/) to easily set up a test endpoint.

#### 1. Create an endpoint
Go to [play.svix.com](https://play.svix.com/) and copy the provided URL that will receive webhooks. You can also provide your own endpoint URL instead.

#### 2. Add the endpoint to TableFlow
Navigate to your [workspace settings](https://app.tableflow.com/settings) in TableFlow cloud. Under the “Webhooks” section, there is where we’ll add the endpoint we just created and choose the `import.completed event` to be notified when users complete a file import:

#### 3. Send a test event
Send a test event to your webhook by navigating to the “Testing” tab, selected the event to send, and pressing “Send Example”:

You’ll be able to see the webhook received on [Svix Play](https://play.svix.com/), and under the “Logs” tab of the webhooks settings:

After configuring your application to receive webhooks, all subscribed events will be sent to the endpoint. You can now import a file to test out your new webhook!
