title: Templates
---

Templates define the columns expected during import. The `template` object is used in the front-end SDKs ([React](/sdk/react) | [Javascript](/sdk/javascript)) and the [API](/api-reference/create-importer).

The schema for the template contains an array of `columns` with the following parameters:

- `name` **(required)**: The name of the column.
- `key`: The key of the column which is used when retrieving data. Note this must be unique and only contain letters, numbers, and underscores. If not provided, a key will be generated from the `name`.
- `required`: Users must map a column from their file to this column to proceed with the import.
- `description`: Set a description displayed as a tooltip in the importer.
- `suggested_mappings`: An array of column header names that the importer will use to auto-select the mapping for the user if the column header in their file matches one of these values (case-insensitive). Note that these must be unique across all columns.

```javascript
{
  columns: [
    {
      name: "First Name",
      key: "first_name",
      required: true,
      description: "The first name of the user",
      suggested_mappings: ["First Name", "Name"]
    },
    {
      name: "Last Name"
    },
    {
      name: "Email",
      required: true,
      description: "The email of the user"
    }
  ]
}
```
