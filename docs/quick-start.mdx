## ‚òÅÔ∏è TableFlow Cloud

The quickest way to get started with TableFlow is signing up for free
to [TableFlow Cloud](https://app.tableflow.com/signup)

## üë©‚Äçüíª Self-hosted deploy (local)

You can run TableFlow locally with Docker:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tableflowhq/tableflow.git
cd tableflow
docker-compose up -d
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access TableFlow.

## ü§ñ Self-hosted deploy (AWS EC2)

**Important notes:**

1. [ ] Make sure the server you use is only accessible within your VPC
2. [ ] Make sure your local machine is able to connect to the server on ports 3000 (the web server) and 3003 (the API
server)
3. [ ] Update your network settings to allow port 3001 (the importer iframe) to be accessible from where your users will
import data, most likely public

One-line install script (for Amazon Linux):

```bash
sudo yum update -y && \
sudo yum install -y docker git && \
sudo service docker start && \
sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER && \
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.19.1/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose && \
sudo mv /usr/local/bin/docker-compose /usr/bin/docker-compose && \
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/docker-compose && \
git clone https://github.com/tableflowhq/tableflow.git && cd tableflow && \
cp .env.example .env && \
sg docker -c 'docker-compose up -d'
```
