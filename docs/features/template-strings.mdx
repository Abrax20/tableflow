title: Template Strings
description: Embed variables from database rows in your actions

When adding an action, you can insert data from the row into the response body of the POST request by using template strings.

For instance, if your table has a column called `email`, you would put the value `${email}` in the request body: `{"text":"User created: ${email}!"}`

The prefixes `new.` and `old.` can be used if a new (INSERT, UPDATE) or old (UPDATE, DELETE) row is available. If a prefix is not specified, the new or old values will be used depending on the event. Example: `{"text":"User updated: ${old.email} is now ${new.email}!"}`

Meta values can also be used to get more query information. The following are available:

1. `meta.table` (table name)
2. `meta.schema` (schema name)
3. `meta.event` (INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE)
4. `meta.user` (the Postgres user who ran the query that triggered the trigger)
5. `meta.event_summary` (a formatted summary of the user, table, and event)
6. `meta.changed` (the values changed for an UPDATE)
