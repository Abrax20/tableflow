title: Template Strings
description: Embed variables from database rows in your actions

When adding an action, you can insert data from the row into the response body of the POST request by using template strings.

For instance, if your table has a column called `email`, you would put the value `${email}` in the request body: `{"text":"User created: ${email}!"}`

The prefixes `new.` and `old.` can be used if a new (INSERT, UPDATE) or old (UPDATE, DELETE) row is available. If a prefix is not specified, the new or old values will be used depending on the event. Example: `{"text":"User updated: ${old.email} is now ${new.email}!"}`

The meta values `meta.table` (table name), `meta.schema` (schema name), `meta.event` (INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE) can also be used.
