description: Real-time events platform for Postgres
---

Inquery is an open source tool for Postgres that triggers webhooks when rows are inserted, updated, or deleted. This includes firing serverless functions, sending notifications, transferring data real-time, or anything else that can be triggered by firing a webhook.

## How It Works

1. Data is modified in Postgres table (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
2. Postgres trigger notifies the Inquery web server via a websocket message
3. Inquery formats the data and sends the webhook(s)

## Use Cases

- **Send notifications:** Slack, Email, Text Message, Push Notification
- **Call serverless functions:** AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions
- **Trigger analytics events:** Segment, Mixpanel, Amplitude
- **Stream data real-time:** Snowflake, BigQuery, Clickhouse, Redshift

## Get Started

### Run Inquery locally

You can run Inquery locally with Docker.

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/inqueryio/inquery.git
cd inquery
docker-compose up -d
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access Inquery.

**Note**: When connecting your database, if your Postgres host is `localhost`, you must use `host.docker.internal` instead to access it when running with Docker.

### Run Inquery on AWS (EC2)

**Note**: Make sure this instance is only accessible within your VPC.\
**Note**: These instructions are for Amazon Linux 2 AMI (HVM).

1. To install Docker, run the following command in your SSH session on the instance terminal:

```bash
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install -y docker
sudo service docker start
sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER
logout # Needed to close the SSH session so Docker does not have to be run as root
```

2. To install `docker-compose`, run the following command in your ssh session on the instance terminal:

```bash
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.16.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)"  -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo mv /usr/local/bin/docker-compose /usr/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/docker-compose
docker-compose version
```

3. Install and run Inquery

```bash
mkdir inquery && cd inquery
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/inqueryio/inquery/main/{.env,docker-compose.yml,.dockerignore,frontend.env}
docker-compose up -d
```

## Features

### Template Strings

When adding an action, you can insert data from the row into the response body of the POST request by using template strings.

For instance, if your table has a column called `email`, you would put the value `${email}` in the request body: `{"text":"User created: ${email}!"}`

The prefixes `new.` and `old.` can be used if a new (INSERT, UPDATE) or old (UPDATE, DELETE) row is available. If a prefix is not specified, the new or old values will be used depending on the event. Example: `{"text":"User updated: ${old.email} is now ${new.email}!"}`

The meta values `meta.table` (table name), `meta.schema` (schema name), `meta.event` (INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE) can also be used.

## Roadmap

- Filters and mapping options for row data when sending a POST request
