title: API Overview
---

Flipt's API is the primary way to interact with Flipt outside of the UI. It's used to create, update, and delete entities such as namespaces, flags, segments, rules, and also to evaluate flags.

The Flipt UI is completely backed by this same API. This means that anything that can be done in the Flipt UI can also be done via the REST API.

The Flipt REST API can also be used with any language that can make HTTP requests.

The latest version of the REST API is fully documented using the [OpenAPI v3 specification](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt-openapi).

## Backward Compatibility

We take great care to ensure that the Flipt REST API is backward compatible. This means that you can safely upgrade to a newer version of Flipt without having to change your API calls.

From time to time we may need to make large changes to the API as we introduce additional features, however we will continue to make sure that we preserve backward compatibility.

We will describe any major changes in the section below.
