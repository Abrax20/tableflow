After a user completes a CSV or Excel file import, you have a few options for how to retrieve the cleaned and mapped data.

### Option 1: SDK
The [React](/sdk/react) and [JavaScript](/sdk/javascript) SDKs have an `onComplete` event that is triggered when an import is completed. The `data` object contains the actual row data along with information about the completed import such as the number of rows imported. It's important to note that there is a 10,000 row limit when using frontend callbacks.

```javascript
onComplete: (data) => console.log(data)
```

### Option 2: Webhooks & API

<Info>Feature available in <a href="https://tableflow.com/pricing" target="_blank">TableFlow Cloud</a>.</Info>

TableFlow provides an API to retrieve import data, paginate the row data of an import (used for large imports), or download an import directly as a CSV.

- [Get Import](/api-reference/get-import)
- [Get Import Rows](/api-reference/get-import-rows)
- [Download Import CSV](/api-reference/download-import)

You can also use [Webhooks](/webhooks) to get notified when an import has been completed. This allows your backend application to load the imported data as soon as an import has completed.


### Option 3: Admin Dashboard

<Info>Feature available in <a href="https://tableflow.com/pricing" target="_blank">TableFlow Cloud</a>.</Info>

The easiest way to access imported data is right within [admin dashboard](app.tableflow.com) under the “Data” tab. Here you can download the files directly as a CSV. While this is useful for testing, you’ll likely want to use the one of the other options for production systems.
