---

When setting up your database in Inquery, you'll need a Postgres user to connect to the database. You can either use an existing user or create a new one. This guide shows how to create a new Postgres user with the correct permissions needed for Inquery.

If you're using an existing user, make sure the user has the `create` permission on the schema(s) you want to use.

**Note:** If you want Inquery to also clean up the triggers and functions it creates when all actions are removed on a table, the user needs to be an owner as Postgres does not have a "drop" permission.

### Why is the `create` Permission Needed?
Inquery uses the create permission to create triggers and functions. A trigger (and corresponding function) is created whenever a new action on a table is added which doesn't have the Inquery trigger already.

Inquery will delete the trigger and function it created if the last action on a table is removed, so it doesn't leave any extra triggers on your database.

You can see how the trigger works by looking at its implementation in [util.go](https://github.com/inqueryio/inquery/blob/c9218751f5b1399b1536be1c1f028828d05d4f70/backend/go/pkg/util/util.go#L54-L117).

#### 1. Create the User
```sql
create user inquery with encrypted password 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX';
```

#### 2. Grant Create Access

```sql
grant create on schema public to inquery;
-- If you have tables in a schema other than `public`, add the schema here
grant create on schema your_other_schema_if_needed to inquery;
```
