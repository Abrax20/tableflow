A common request engineers receive is to notify other team members when a specific action occurs. The most obvious example is "send a Slack message when a new user is created." With Inquery, you can set this up quickly and without writing any code. First you'll need to prepare Slack to receive incoming webhooks. Then you'll create an action in Inquery that triggers this newly created webhook in Slack.

## Setup Slack Webhook

Slack offers a very handy feature that enables developers to use webhooks to send messages. Slack calls these "apps", but in this case they're really just lightweight actions.

#### 1. Create Slack App
Follow [this link](https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app) and click the "Create New App" button to get started. Then select "From scratch" to continue to the configuration page.

#### 2. Congifure App
You can name the app anything you like, but we suggest "Inquery". Then select the Slack Workspace where the messages will be sent.

Under the "Features and functionality" section, find and click on the "Incoming Webhooks" option.

#### 7. Copy Webhook URL
Great, now you've got a Slack App that's ready to receive incoming webhooks. Scroll to the bottom of the "Incoming Webhooks" page and use the "Copy" button to copy the webhook URL.

## Create Inquery Action

Now that you've got the incoming webhook ready in Slack, you can now trigger it with an Inquery action.

#### 1. Create Inquery Action
Navigate to the "Actions" section of the Inquery web app and click the "Create" button.

#### 2. Configure Inquery Action
Name the new action (ex: "New User Slack Message"). Then select the appropriate schema and table. Check the "INSERT" box to trigger a message for every new row added to the specified table.

#### 3. Specify Slack Message
First paste the Slack Webhook URL from the section above into the URL field. Then specify the Slack message contents. You can use template strings with the column name as the variable.
```javascript
{
  "text": "New User Created: ${email}"
}
```

## Try It Out ðŸŽ‰
That's it! If everything's set up correctly, you should be good to go. As soon as a new row is added to the specified table, you'll receive a message to the specified Slack Channel.
