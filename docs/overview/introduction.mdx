Inquery is an open-source toolkit for safeguarding PostgreSQL databases. It includes the following tools:

* **[Alerts](#alerts):** Receive notifications when a change occurs
* **[Audit History](#audit-history--beta-):** View all historical manual changes with context
* **[Query Preview](#query-preview--coming-soon-):** Preview affected rows and query plan prior to running changes
* **[Approval Flow](#approval-flow--coming-soon-):** Require query review before a change can be run

## Alerts

Alerts can be used to send notifications when a database change is made (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).

* Send notifications to Slack, email, or any other webhook
* Filter-out changes made by application users to only see manual updates
* Use template strings (column values, user, etc.) to see what was changed and by who

### How It Works

1. Data is modified in a Postgres table (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
2. A Postgres trigger notifies the Inquery web server via a websocket message
3. Inquery formats, filters, and sends the data to configured webhook(s)

## Audit History (beta)

View all manual data updates that occurred in your Postgres database, even those that weren't initiated through the
Inquery UI.

## Query Preview (coming soon)

Before executing a query, check which tables and rows will be affected. View exactly which columns will be updated and
their new value. Explore the visual query plan generated from EXPLAIN.

## Approval Flow (coming soon)

Submit a query for approval by teammates instead of running them directly against the production database. Auto-approval
rules can be configured based on the number of rows changed, the table being updated, or the user's role.
